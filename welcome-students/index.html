              Grace Baptist has been such a blessing to me during my time at
              Cedarville. The smaller size of the church makes it easy to get to
              know people and the congregation feels like family. I also really
              enjoy serving in the children’s ministry!

              I love the community at Grace; everyone is genuine and welcoming.
              My time with them was always edifying, it really seemed like the
              church cared for me personally and they even found ways for me to
              serve.

              The worship is excellent and God glorifying; preaching and
              teaching is exegetical and exhortative, the songs that are sung
              are rich in doctrine and stir the heart in worship, and they
              fervently pray for each other.

              From Sunday meals together, to evening bonfires, and encouraging
              texts throughout the week, I always knew the people here were
              praying for me and supporting me. That was so important to me as a
              college student! They invested in me and loved me, a true picture

              years. Not only is the preaching full of wisdom, but the love that
              the congregation gives is unbelievable. From weekly lunches, the
              check up texts, and prayers, I knew that this church cared for us

              While I was going to college, I felt kind of lost in life and
              disconnected from God. It was the people and the ministry of Grace
              Baptist that, in a sense, saved me from depression and gave me a
              place where I felt like I belonged and loved like family.

              As a former Cedarville student, finding a church had its
              challenges because there are so many great ones. Going to Grace
              Baptist was an amazing experience because not only was it the
