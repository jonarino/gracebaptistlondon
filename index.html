            Ministry is about people. We’re constantly connecting with rich
            conversations and detailed prayers for one another.

            Our elders and deacons care for this local group of God’s Church;
            we share each other’s burdens and check on physical and spiritual
            needs throughout the week. We love to have children in our
            services, where they see and participate in age-integrated
            worship.

            Do you want to have a purpose bigger than yourself? We purpose to
            develop believers who will make an impact by choosing the Bible as
            their standard. God’s Word accomplishes what He desires, and its
            ripple effects have gone from London, Ohio to around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our missionaries broaden our impact as our messengers to other
            places to carry on this proclamation. The same can be said of some
            of our own who have joined military service and are living the
            Gospel wherever they travel.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the school year, we encourage college students who worship
            with us. They then move on to carry the Good News to other places.
          </p>
          <p>
            And we start at the beginning by training up children in various
            ways to love Jesus and follow him. Our services and events are
            designed to be complete yet concise, based on Biblical principles:
            fellowship, missions, service, instruction, thanksgiving.

            Do you want to know the truth? Real and lasting truth is only
            found in God’s unchanging, always-relevant Holy Bible.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are committed to honor the Lord through the proclamation of
            Biblical truth as the standard for obedience, the Christian life,
            Biblical worship (God-focused, Christ-centered, Holy
            Spirit-empowered), and service to others.

            This has been true since our formation in 1967, and is
            communicated throughout our doctrinal statement. Check it out for
