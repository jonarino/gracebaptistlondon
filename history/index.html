      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <h2>1967</h2>
      <p>
        In early 1967, Grace Baptist Church began as a Bible study in the home
        of Elvin and Joyce King, 148 Hawthorne Avenue, London. The impetus for
        the new work came from the Swordbearers, a student outreach ministry
        from Cedarville College, who had been holding street meetings in London
        for several months. Five interested families and other individuals, with
        the help of Rev. Earl Umbaugh, state missionary, started an area Bible
        study, meeting once a week in various homes. Sunday services were first
        held on May 14, 1967, using the lower level of the new John Gibboney
        Building at 233 West High Street. A short time later the group occupied
        the first floor as well. The pulpit supply came from visiting pastors,
        deacons, and missionaries, as well as students and professors from
        Cedarville College. Financial help, as well as many of the furnishings
        were received from area churches.
      </p>
      <p>
        David W. Morris, as a candidate, supplied the pulpit on June 25, 1967,
        was extended a call to be pastor on June 28, and arrived in August to
        assume his duties. An ordination council was called for May 25, 1968,
        for the purpose of ordaining him into the Baptist ministry. The
        Recognition Council for Grace Baptist Church met on April 2, 1968, and
        unanimously approved the church as a duly organized and properly
        constituted Baptist Church, associated with the General Association of
        Regular Baptist Churches and the Ohio Association of Regular Baptist
        Churches.
      </p>
      <h2>1968</h2>
      <p>
        Plans were formulated during the summer of 1968 for the construction of
        a new building. Through the loving generosity of Ralph and Martha Davin,
        the church was able to purchase land at 121 North Madison Road in the
        spring of 1968, and construction began that August. The building was
        completed in January of 1969, and on January 25, Grace Baptist Church
        met for worship in its own building for the first time. Dedication
        services were held on the second anniversary of the church’s beginning,
        May 11, 1969. The Conn organ was purchased and installed in August of
        1971 which added greatly to the worship services. In 1972, the church
        purchased new pews and pulpit furniture. Stanley Johnson furnished the
        labor and blacktopped the parking lot and driveway in April of 1972,
        which provided a measure of comfort for members and guests. In May of
        1976 approval was given for building an addition to the church, which
        included adding four additional classrooms and a kitchenette, enlarging
        existing classrooms and the nursery, and installing air-conditioning
        throughout the entire building. The entrance porch was enclosed in 1984
        to provide an airlock entrance to the building. Pastor Morris continued
        to shepherd the church for more than twenty years, resigning at the end
        of 1987. Dr. Floyd Elmore from Cedarville College then served as interim
        pastor for thirteen months.
      </p>
      <h2>1989</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="/elders">Dwain A. Hill</a> accepted the church’s call to become
        pastor in early 1989, and began his ministry in February of that year.
        He was formally installed as pastor in April of 1989 and continues to
        serve Grace Baptist Church. In 1989, the parking lot was extended and
        new blacktopping laid. A bequest from the estate of Alta Stewart made
        possible new hymnals and pew Bibles in 1991. New carpeting was installed
        in the older part of the building. The Davins’ thoughtful remembrance of
        the church in their wills made it possible for Grace Baptist Church to
        be debt-free for the church’s twenty-fifth anniversary, celebrated May
        17, 1992.
      </p>
      <p>
        Awana Clubs for children began in the fall of 1992 and continued through
        the spring of 2003 when we were disappointed to no longer be able to
        staff the program. AWANA challenged children of all ages each Wednesday
        evening during the school year. Its three parts were comprised of
        individual Scripture memory, a large circle game time, and a group
        devotional challenge. There was large participation at various levels
        from much of the congregation.
      </p>
      <h2>1995-1999</h2>
      <p>A synopsis of the highlights of the next few years include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            In 1995 we had an unusually high number of guest speakers, groups
            and musicians.
          </p>
          <p>
            Printing equipment was updated with the purchase of a photocopier.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In 1996 the sound system was updated and included lapel microphone.
          </p>
          <p>
            A new roof was put on the building, and landscaping was added to
            beautify the grounds.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In 1997, and for several years after, the church tried staffing an
            evangelism booth at the Madison County Fair.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pavilion was built through the generosity of Debbie Dunlap; many
            picnics, graduations, anniversaries and various events have been
            sheltered by this structure, not to mention that many church
            neighbors are free to enjoy the yard and the shade!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In 1999, Grace Baptist Church sent a team to Zambia comprised of
            Pastor Hill, Jim Young and Jesse Hill. They were to see and
            encourage the ministry of Jim and Rachel Chambers. Pastor and Jim
            taught a two-week series of classes on the family, and Jesse
            remained in Zambia for three months to help with the construction of
            the church building there, traveling home with the Chambers when
            they returned for furlough.
          </p>
          <p>
            That year also saw new office furniture for the pastor’s study. It
            was also the first year that the ladies tried and enjoyed a fall
            retreat at Lake Hope in southern Ohio.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>2000</h2>
      <p>
        During the year 2000, in co-operation with a city-wide drive, we
        distributed the “Jesus” video to the neighborhood surrounding the
        church. That year, the women became part of something bigger by
        preparing gospel bracelets for a gospel outreach at the Winter Olympics
        held in Salt Lake City, Utah.
      </p>
      <h2>2001</h2>
      <p>
        2001 was the year of Home-going for Pastor Morris, a bittersweet time of
        missing a dear friend, but a time of rejoicing as he met his Savior. A
        drinking fountain and the first laptop computer for the pastor were
        small additions that year.
      </p>
      <h2>2005</h2>
      <p>
        An experiment in 2005 was a kid’s summer “Boot Camp”; it consisted of a
        week of outdoor nightly kids’ lessons and games, and had a military
        theme of Christian soldiers.
      </p>
      <h2>2006</h2>
      <p>
        All it took in 2006 was a gracious offering of one anonymous individual
        which stimulated the giving of many and resulted in a major redecorating
        of the church: a fresh building appearance included complete interior
        painting, new carpet throughout, lowering of the front platform, and a
        new furnace in fellowship hall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, some things have remained constant. A core group has
        always met on Wednesday nights to agree together in prayer for both the
        church body and for other known needs. Sunday School continues to meet
        each Sunday morning and over a period of years has gradually shifted
        from age-segregated classes to a family-integrated Bible Training Hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        For years, the church maintained its own food cupboard, and still
        maintains a benevolent fund to help members as well as others in the
        community. The congregation sings songs and hymns, mixing the
        centuries-old with the new, with a focus on teaching and admonishing one
        another as we praise God together.
      </p>
      <p>
        In looking back over a church ministry, it is easy to list material
        improvements, but not so easy to list spiritual accomplishments that
        have eternal consequences. A quote that was cited in the 2008 annual
        report might help to keep focus on what really matters:
        <figure>
          <blockquote>
            “‘How many people do you have?’ As a pastor for over thirty years, I
            have many times been asked this question, and no doubt, I will be
            asked it may more times if I live. Never has anyone asked me such
            questions as the following: ‘Are your services spiritual?’ ‘Is
            Christ real to your people?’ ‘Are your members hearing the whole
            counsel of God?’ ‘Are your people growing in grace and in the
            knowledge of Christ?’ ‘Is there a spirit of unity and love in your
            church?’ Evidently, these things are not important to modern-day
            religionists, who judge religious success by worldly standards –
            nickels and noses. I just wish one single time that a person would
            ask about something other than nickels and noses.”
          </blockquote>

      </p>
      <p>
        History and hindsight show that there have actually been several
        “congregations” at Grace Baptist Church in its forty-seven years. In
        fact, there have been about 306 different members, eighty of those since
        the twenty-fifth anniversary. As some people move away or move on, God
        brings others to this meeting place where we strive to maintain a
        support group for those who want to be Godly, to prepare people to go
        out and meet their daily mission field, and to herald the never-changing
        truths of God’s Word, “a lamp to our feet and a light to our path.”
