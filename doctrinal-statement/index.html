    <h1>Doctrinal Statement</h1>
    <h2>The Scriptures</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that the Bible, both Old and
      New Testaments, is supernaturally inspired, so that it is inerrant in
      the original manuscripts and preserved by God in its verbal and plenary
      inspiration, so that it is a divinely authoritative standard for every
      age and every life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> the Bible to be the true
      center of Christian union, and the supreme standard by which all human
      conduct, creeds, and opinions should be tried.
    </p>

      <li>2&nbsp;Peter 1:19&ndash;21</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Godhead</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> there is one, and only one
      living and true God, and infinite, intelligent Spirit, the maker and
      Supreme Ruler of heaven and earth; inexpressibly glorious in holiness,
      and worthy of all possible honor, confidence and love; that in the unity
      of the Godhead there are three persons, the Father, the Son, and the
      Holy Ghost, equal in every divine perfection, and executing distinct but
      harmonious offices in the great work of Redemption.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that God is self-existent,
      eternal, and everlasting.

    </ul>
    <h2>The Person and Work of Jesus Christ</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that Jesus Christ, the second
      person of the Trinity, is both true God and true man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> He existed in eternity, that
      He appeared and ministered in the Old Testament, that He was born of a
      virgin, lived a sinless life while performing many miracles.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> He died on the cross,
      shedding His blood, and suffering the full penalty of divine wrath for
      sinful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that He was buried, and on
      the third day He arose bodily from the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that He ascended bodily into
      heaven where, at the right hand of the Father, He now intercedes as the
      only mediator between God and those who believe on Him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> He is coming again to rapture
      the Church and will return literally to earth after the Tribulation to
      set up His millennial kingdom.
    </p>
    <ul class="scripture-citations">
      <li>Matthew 1:20&ndash;21, 28</li>

      <li>Hebrews 9:28</li>
      <li>1&nbsp;John 5:20</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Holy Spirit</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that the Holy Spirit is a
      divine person; equal with God the Father and God the Son. The Holy
      Spirit actively ministered in the Old Testament through creation,
      revelation, and in a special selective manner with men. The Holy Spirit
      was active in all aspects of Christ’s life, from His birth to His death
      and resurrection. The Holy Spirit today has a prime ministry in
      salvation as He convicts, regenerates, indwells, baptizes (this baptism
      occurs at salvation and is not a subsequent or second work of grace),
      and seals the new believers. The Holy Spirit gifts, controls, teaches,
      guides, assures, and prays for believers.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> the Holy Spirit fills
      believers in response to yieldedness with the goal of conforming them to
      the image of Christ.
    </p>
    <ul class="scripture-citations">
      <li>Psalm 139:7&ndash;12</li>

      <li>1&nbsp;Corinthians 6:19</li>
      <li>1&nbsp;Corinthians 12:13</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Devil or Satan</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> in the reality and
      personality of Satan, the Devil, and that he was created by God as an
      angel but through pride and rebellion became the enemy of his Creator;
      that he became the unholy god of this age and the ruler of all the
      powers of darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> he was conquered by Christ on
      the cross and is destined to the judgment of an eternal justice in the
      lake of fire.
    </p>
    <ul class="scripture-citations">
      <li>Matthew 4:1&ndash;11</li>
      <li>2&nbsp;Corinthians 4:4</li>
      <li>Colossians 2:14&ndash;15</li>
      <li>Revelation 20:10</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Creation</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> in the Biblical account of
      Creation, including angels, physical universe, and man, and that this is
      a literal, historical account of the direct, immediate, creative acts of
      God, without any evolutionary process.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that the six creative days of
      Genesis 1 were literal twenty-four hour days.
    </p>
    <ul class="scripture-citations">
      <li>Genesis 1:26&ndash;27</li>
      <li>Genesis 2:7&ndash;9, 16, 17</li>
      <li>Genesis 3:1&ndash;19</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Total Depravity of Man</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that all men are descended
      from the historical Adam and Eve, parents of the human race. By
      voluntary transgression man fell from his sinless state, in consequence
      of which all men are now sinners by nature and by choice, utterly devoid
      of the holiness required by God, positively inclined to evil, and
      therefore under just condemnation to eternal judgment and everlasting
      existence separated from God and without defense or excuse.
    </p>
    <ul class="scripture-citations">
      <li>Genesis 3:6</li>
      <li>Romans 1:18, 32</li>
      <li>Romans 3:10-19</li>
      <li>Romans 5:12-19</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Salvation</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that Christ died, was buried,
      and rose again for the whole world and that salvation of sinners is
      divinely initiated, wholly of grace, and accomplished only through the
      mediatorial work of the Son of God. We believe in salvation by grace
      through faith: that salvation is the free gift of God, neither merited
      nor secured in part or in whole by any virtue or work of man, but
      received only by genuine repentance and personal faith in the Lord Jesus
      Christ, in whom all true believers have as a present possession the gift
      of eternal life, a perfect righteousness, sonship in the family of God,
      deliverance and security from all condemnation, every spiritual resource
      needed for life and godliness, and the divine guarantee that they shall
      never perish; that this salvation affects the whole man; that apart from
      Christ there is no possible salvation.
    </p>
    <ul class="scripture-citations">
      <li>John 1:12</li>
      <li>John 3:14</li>

      <li>Acts 16:31</li>

      <li>Philippians 1:6</li>
      <li>Titus 3:5</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Grace and the New Birth</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that faith in the Lord Jesus
      Christ is the only condition of salvation; that in order to be saved,
      sinners must be born again; that the new birth is a new creation in
      Christ Jesus; that it is instantaneous and not a process; that in the
      new birth the one dead in trespasses and in sins is made a partaker of
      the divine nature and receives eternal life, the free gift of God; that
      the new creation is brought about in a manner above our comprehension,
      not by culture, not by character, nor by the will of man, but wholly and
      solely by the power of the Holy Spirit in connection with divine truth,
      so as to secure our voluntary obedience to the Gospel; that its proper
      evidence appears in the holy fruits of repentance and faith and newness
      of life.
    </p>

      <li>1&nbsp;John 5:1</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Justification</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that justification is the
      judicial act of God, wherein He declares the believer righteous because
      of the imputed righteousness of Christ, and that it is given not because
      of works but only through faith in the Redeemer’s blood.
    </p>
    <ul class="scripture-citations">
      <li>Romans 3:24</li>
      <li>Romans 4:5</li>
      <li>Romans 5:1-9</li>
      <li>Galatians 2:16</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sanctification</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that sanctification is the
      divine setting apart of the believer unto God, accomplished in a
      threefold manner: first, an eternal act of God, based upon redemption in
      Christ, establishing the believer in a position of holiness at the
      moment he trusts the Savior; second, a continuing process in the saint
      as the Holy Spirit applies the Word of God to the life; third, the final
      accomplishment of this process at the Lord’s return.

      <li>Jude 23, 25</li>
      <li>Revelation 22:11</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Separation</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> in personal separation from
      all worldly and sinful pleasures, practices, influences, and
      associations which bring reproach upon the Savior and which hinder a
      Spirit-filled life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> the Bible commands separation
      from all forms of ecclesiastical liberalism, apostasy, and compromise,
      including any organization which would unite believers with the unsaved
      in a secretive manner.
    </p>
    <ul class="scripture-citations">
      <li>Romans 6:1&ndash;14</li>

      <li>James 4:4</li>
      <li>1&nbsp;John 2:15&ndash;17</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Security of the Saints</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that all the redeemed, once
      saved, are kept by God's power and are thus secure in Christ forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that it is the privilege of
      believers to rejoice in the assurance of their salvation, through the
      testimony of God's word which, however, clearly forbids the use of
      Christian liberty as an occasion to the flesh.
    </p>

      <li>Jude 4</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Local Church</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> in the importance of the
      local church: that a New Testament church is a local assembly of
      born-again immersed believers united by covenant to practice the New
      Testament ordinances of water baptism and the Lord’s Supper; to meet
      together for prayer, fellowship, teaching, and a united testimony.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> its Scriptural offices are
      pastor (elder, bishop) and deacon whose qualifications, claims, and
      duties are clearly defined in the Scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> in the independence and
      autonomy of the local church; that each New Testament church is free to
      govern itself without outside interference and is directly accountable
      to God.
    </p>

      <li>1&nbsp;Timothy 3:1&ndash;15</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The New Testament Church Ordinances</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> the two church ordinances
      given to the local church are baptism and the Lord’s Supper; that
      baptism is by immersion of believers in water to show forth our
      identification with the crucified, buried, and risen Savior, through
      Whom we died to sin and rose to a new life.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that the Lord’s Supper is the
      partaking of the bread and the cup by the believer as a continuing
      memorial of the broken body and shed blood of Christ until He comes.
    </p>
    <ul class="scripture-citations">
      <li>Matthew 28:19&ndash;20</li>

      <li>Colossians 2:12</li>
      <li>1&nbsp;Corinthians 11:23&ndash;28</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Righteous and the Wicked</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that there is a radical and
      essential difference between the righteous and the wicked; that only
      those who are justified by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ and sanctified
      by the Spirit of our God are truly righteous in His esteem; while all
      such as continue in impenitence and unbelief are in His sight wicked and
      under the curse; and this distinction holds among men both in and after
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> in the bodily resurrection of
      all dead; the saved to a life of eternal glory and blessing in heaven
      with God; the unsaved to eternal judgment of conscious suffering in the
      Lake of Fire.

    <h2>Civil Government</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> civil government is of divine
      order and planning for the general orderliness and well-being of
      mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> the powers that be are
      ordained by God, and all governments owe their power, right to rule, and
      existence to God.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> civil government is to punish
      the evil-doer and give praise unto those that do well.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> government has the biblical
      responsibility to practice capital punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> we are to pray for our civil
      leaders, honor them, obey the law of the land, and render unto the
      government its due taxes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> in submitting to every
      ordinance and law of civil government, except when government would tell
      us to do things opposed to the will and Word of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that civil government has no
      right to legislate or seek to control matters of religious faith or
      practice.

    <h2>Future Events</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> in the imminent “blessed
      hope”, the rapture of the church before the Tribulation, when “the Lord
      shall descend from heaven” to catch up His bride to meet Him in the air
      and to participate in the Judgment Seat of Christ and the Marriage of
      the Lamb in heaven; that the Tribulation will begin on the earth
      subsequently, culminating in the literal return of Christ to earth at
      the end of the Tribulation, the setting up of His millennial reign which
      is followed by the eternal state, including the new heaven and the new
      earth.

    </ul>
    <h2>Marriage and the Home</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that the family was the first
      institution God provided for mankind, and that marriage is a sacred
      relationship and honorable for all. Marriage is used as an emblem of the
      union of Christ and His Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> marriage is a permanent
      covenant before God and man and between one man and one woman and any
      other arrangement is unbiblical.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> God’s design is for a married
      couple to never be separated by divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> men and women are of equal
      value and standing in God’s sight, but by God’s design the man is to be
      head of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> it is the responsibility of
      parents to raise their children in the nurture and admonition of the
      Lord while practicing loving discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that single believers are to
      marry only in the Lord.
    </p>

      <li>Ephesians 5:21, 23</li>
      <li>Ephesians 6:4</li>
      <li>Hebrews 12:4</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Sexual Relationships</h2>
    <p>
      <span class="label-text">We believe</span> that the Bible specifically
      places man and woman in a Biblical, God-commanded relationship and that
      God instituted the marriage relationship between man and woman, and the
      creation of the Biblical family. We therefore hold that it is totally
      against the command and teaching of the Word of God to in any way change
      or pervert this order. Thus, we must Biblically conclude that
      homosexuality, lesbianism, and any other contra-biblical relationships
      are contrary to the Word of God, and we do not accept these as an
      alternate life-style.
